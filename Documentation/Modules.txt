=== PURPOSE ===
Modules provide the compositional functions the pipeline goes through
by means of a server-client model wherein the module provider is
started by AutoMuse (the client) and communication between the two
commences.

=== CONFIGURATION STORAGE ===
Each module provider (server) maintains its own configurations. The
client forwards configuration communications to these servers which
must then modify their configurations accordingly. However, if the
user so desires, they may specify variables shared by any number of
servers to be "tied" together. This tying occurs on the client side
only. Whenever a configuration is made for a shared variable, the
client forwards the configuration to the many servers which share
it.
